You don’t need more motivation. You need consequences.
Discipline isn’t a habit. It’s a blood oath.
The man who trains in silence destroys the loudest room.
Comfort kills kings.
Suffer voluntarily, or be forced to suffer later.
Soft habits destroy strong visions.
You weren't made to blend in. You were made to lead warriors.
A lion doesn't beg sheep for validation.
Fear is the mind’s disease. Starve it.
You either master your emotions or your emotions master you.
